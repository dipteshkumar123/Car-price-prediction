# Car Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict car prices based on historical data of various car models. The prediction is facilitated by machine learning algorithms trained on features such as car specifications, market trends, and economic indicators.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing includes historical records of car models, their specifications, previous selling prices, and other relevant features. The dataset is sourced from reliable automotive market databases and includes data from recent years.

## Features
- **Car Specifications**: Engine size, mileage, transmission type, fuel type, etc.
- **Market Trends**: Historical pricing trends, seasonality, and economic factors affecting car prices.
- **Geographical Factors**: Regional variations in car pricing and availability.
- **Model Year**: Impact of age on depreciation and resale value.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.
2. **Model Selection**: Comparative analysis of regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
3. **Training**: Splitting data into training and validation sets.
4. **Evaluation**: Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) used to evaluate model performance.
5. **Prediction**: Using trained models to predict future car prices based on input features.

## Usage
To use this project:
1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure Python and necessary libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib) are installed.
2. **Run Scripts**: Execute scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
3. **Input**: Provide car specifications for prediction using trained models.
4. **Output**: Predicted car prices based on input features.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate real-time market data for dynamic price predictions.
- Enhance model accuracy through more sophisticated algorithms and additional features.
- Develop a user-friendly interface for easier input and output interaction.
